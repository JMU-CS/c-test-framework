<h2>Project 0: Intro project</h2>

<p> This project serves as an introduction to developing and compiling C
programs, as well as to the build, testing, and submission framework used in
this class. The actual code you must write to receive credit for this project
is trivial, allowing you to focus on the mechanics of completing a project in
this course. </p>

<h3>Regular Requirements</h3>

<p> These sections describe what you must do to receive credit for completing
P0. </p>

<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>

<p> Here are the functions that you must implement in <tt>p0-intro.c</tt>: </p>

<ul>

    <li class="compact"> <tt>int add_abs (int num1, int num2)</tt> <br />
        <br /> Returns the sum of the absolute values of the two parameters.
        </li>

    <li> <tt>int factorial (int num);</tt> <br />
        <br /> Return the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a>
        of non-negative inputs; otherwise, returns 1.</li>

    <li> <tt>int sum_array (int *nums, size_t n);</tt> <br />
        <br /> Return the sum of all numbers in an array of length <tt>n</tt>.
        </li>

</ul>

<p> There are several unit tests; some are public and you can view the source
code in <tt>tests/public.c</tt>, while others are private, meaning you do not
have access to their source code. This will be the case for all projects in
this course--it is important that you learn to anticipate edge cases and other
errant behavior. </p>

<h4>Integration Requirements</h4>

<p> When run without any command-line parameters, the program should print the
text "<tt>Hello, world!</tt>" followed by a newline character ("<tt>\n</tt>").
This will require you to edit the code in <tt>main.c</tt>. </p>

<p> In addition, there is some required functionality that is activated using
command-line switches. You should implement these features as modes in
<tt>main.c</tt>. One of these modes requires a parameter, which is also passed
as a command-line argument. We recommend using <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html"><tt>getopt</tt></a>
to handle command-line parsing.  </p>

<p> Multiple modes may be active at once, and if any mode is activated, the
original "<tt>Hello, world!</tt>" message should not print. If multiple modes
are activated, their output should be printed in the order they are listed
below. If a mode with a parameter is activated multiple times (via multiple
command-line switches), only the last parameter should be used. </p>

<p> Here is a list of modes: </p>

<ul>

    <li> Goodbye mode ("<tt>-g</tt>") <br />
        <br /> Print "<tt>Goodbye!</tt>" </li>

    <li> Factorial mode ("<tt>-f &lt;n&gt;</tt>") <br />
        <br /> Print the factorial of the given number, using the
        <tt>factorial</tt> function described in the previous section. </li>

    <li> Cat mode ("<tt>-c &lt;file&gt;</tt>") <br />
        <br /> Print each line from the given file to standard out, similar to
        the Unix <tt>cat</tt> utility. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p> Tests have been provided for you. To run these tests, use the "<tt>make
test</tt>" command from the project folder. At first, your output will look
like this: </p>

<p> You should of course write your own tests as well. You should use the
provided tests only as an indicator of how complete your solution is. </p>

<p> Note that in this project, some of the "integration" tests don't really test
for successful integration of smaller program units; they test entirely separate
functionality. This will not be the case in the rest of the projects. </p>
